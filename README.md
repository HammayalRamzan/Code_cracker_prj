## 🛠 How It Works  

### *1️⃣ Select Cipher Type*  
- *Caesar Cipher* (Shift-based encryption)  
- *Vigenère Cipher* (Keyword-based encryption)  

### *2️⃣ Enter Encrypted Text*  
- Paste the *cipher text* in the input box.  

### *3️⃣ Choose Decryption Key*  
- *For Caesar Cipher* → Select a *shift value (1-25)*  
- *For Vigenère Cipher* → Enter a *secret key*  

### *4️⃣ Click "Crack the Code" & Get Your Secret Message!*  
The decrypted message appears instantly! 🔓

## 📜 About Ciphers Used  

### 🔹 *Caesar Cipher*  
A *substitution cipher* where each letter in the plaintext is *shifted* by a fixed number of positions.  
For example, with a *shift of 3*:  

- *A → D*  
- *B → E*  
- *C → F*  
- *HELLO → KHOOR*  

### 🔹 *Vigenère Cipher*  
A *polyalphabetic cipher* that uses a *keyword* to determine shifts for each letter.  
For example, with *key = "KEY"*:  

- *Plaintext: ATTACKATDAWN*  
- *Encrypted Text: KXRKXKZKZKZ*
